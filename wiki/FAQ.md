# FAQ

Q: What input files are supported?
A: Playwright `.js` and `.ts` test files that contain test scenarios are supported. Keep them focused to one test or spec per upload.

Q: Does the tool run tests or just refactor code?
A: It only analyzes and refactors test script source into the POM structure; it doesn't execute tests by itself.

Q: Can I use this without API keys?
A: Yes — a mock or fallback mode can be used for local testing, but real LLM providers produce better results.

Q: Where are generated files saved?
A: Generated pages and data appear in the UI preview and can be downloaded by clicking the download icon.
